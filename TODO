- implement creation of directory structure 
  needs passing of target root and relativ traversal
- implement copying itself
  lazy way would be to use tar for a) and rsync with explicit lists for b)
- implement user handling
- implement security/authentification 
  (workers are running as root, client could be setuid root as well and 
  authenticate with a not-user-readable secret from a config file, or use TLS sockets
  with certificats)
- implement query of job state from client
  needs rpc code on both sides
+ implement load limiting
  atm it runs as many jobs as come in in parallel, some queuing needed, could
  be done with channel on initial worker side (total number of jobs is then
  <= #workers * channel buffer depth)
